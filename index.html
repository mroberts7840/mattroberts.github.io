  <h1>The Offside Rule Explained</h1>
		<img src="images/Linesman.jpg" alt="Linesman holding aloft a red and yellow chequered flag.">
    
<p>A player is offside if, when the ball is played, they are closer to the opposition goal line than both the ball and the last defender.</p>
<p>However, a player can be in an offside position provided they are not <strong>interfering with play.</strong> Interfering with play is defined by FIFA as <strong>playing or touching the ball passed or touched by a team-mate.</strong></p>
<p>Other definitions of interfering with play, other than playing or touching the ball, are</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interfering with an opponent<p/></strong>
<li><strong>Gaining an advantage<p/></strong>
</ul>

<p><strong>You can't be offside if :<p/></strong>
<p>You receive the ball directly from a goal kick, throw-in or corner</p>
<p>You are in your own half of the pitch</p>
